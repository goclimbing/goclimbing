- 👋 Hi, I’m @goclimbing and when I'm not out climbing I'm probably working on a coding project.  I've been writing code and doing many things IT related since the mid-90's.
- 👀 BITD we were hand-coding HTML documents and serving them up on our own home-built web servers. PERL was the coding tool of choice for me as PHP was just a twinkle in the eyes of Rasmus.  
- 🌱 Eventually CMSs came along and made life easy.  Except if found myself developing in Typo3 for nearly a decade. About seven years ago I found WordPress and that changed everything.  Since then my primary focus has been developing custom wordpress functionality.
- 💞️ Git plays a huge role in my devops framework.  Laraval valet, VSCode and Git.
